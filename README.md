# TitanicProject
Through the use of a Decision Tree, I created a Titanic classifier which predicts whether or not a passenger survived. I also used gradient descent to create a logistic regression.

# How it Works
**Decision Tree:**\
Through the use of entropy, I build a chart of how much information is gained from a certain split, and whichever split yields the highest entropy, aka information gained, gives me the split on that level.

**Logistic Regression:**\
Through the use of math and partial derivatives, I calculate the gradient and then use gradient descent through code to figure out the exact weights behind the sigmoid function.
